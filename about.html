<p>My name is Samaya Windley, and I am a libero with a deep passion for volleyball. I currently play for South East Region Volleyball and attend Kempsville High School. Volleyball has been a huge part of my life, and it motivates me to constantly improve both on and off the court. Whether it's training, competing, or supporting my teammates, I give my best every day. My dedication to the sport drives me to push harder, train smarter, and aim higher every day.
</p>

<p>When I'm not on the court, I enjoy spending time with my family, studying hard to maintain my GPA, and working on my goals to play at the collegiate level. My goal is to continue to grow as a player and as a person. I value hard work, teamwork, and resilience, and I strive to bring those qualities to every match.
